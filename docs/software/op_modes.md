Op Modes {#op_modes}
=====================

The op modes (short for Operational Modes) are the different portions of the game:

Auto or Autonomous refers to the portion of the game the robot drives itself without interaction from the drivers,
this usually lasts 30 seconds.

\note There is a period of time before the match starts where the robot is placed on the field, and the drivers are allowed to use the gamepads.
\note This happens before randomization, and can be used to configure the auto mode.

The Teleop period starts directly after that, and lasts 90 seconds (1 and 1/2 minutes), two drivers use 1 gamepad each to send instructions to the robot.
