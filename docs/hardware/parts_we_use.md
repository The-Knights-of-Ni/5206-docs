Parts We Use {#parts_we_use}
=============

## Strafer Chassis

Chassis may change depending on the need presented in the competition,
however, this Chassis is the most common and most basic form to house wheels and motors.
This allows flexibility for further structures and tools for the competition.
Again, this is quite flexible depending on different needs presented by the competition.

## Motors

Motors are vital for larger rotational functions in the robot.
These motors are primarily used to rotate the wheels;
however, there are certain scenarios where motors can be used for further function.
For example, last year during the Freight Frenzy competition,
we used motors to lift a heavy bin due to the need for stronger lifting power only available through a motor.

## Servos

Servos are smaller motors that allow us to carry out simple rotational functions.
This can mean serving as the joint for arms, spinning for duck wheels, and much more.
In accordance with FTC guidelines, teams are allowed to use more servos than motors.

## Mecanum

We use mecanum wheels as they allow for the robot to move sideways and diagonally without having to turn.
This will help in run time as we can save time by moving diagonally rather than going straight then turning.
