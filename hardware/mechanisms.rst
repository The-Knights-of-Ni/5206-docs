Mechanisms
============

Linear Slide
______________

Our linear slides are bought from Gobilda (https://www.gobilda.com/linear-slides/).
They offer 240 and 336 mm long linear slides. Utilizing dark magic stringing, a motor can power the linear slide, allowing it to go up. This is useful because it allows mechanisms attached on the linear slide to reach very high places. 

Intake
_________

The intake is a self-designed mechanism that takes the game piece from the player station and keeps it in the robot. We either use surgical tubing or compliant wheels. 
Our intake wheels are bought from Gobilda as well (https://www.gobilda.com/intake-wheels/#rollers)


Claw
________

The claw is a self-designed mechanism that allows the bot to manipulate the game piece. This year, we used a claw to pick up the game element, the pixel, from the intake and places it on the backboard. 
These mechanisms are powered by servos bought from Gobilda (https://www.gobilda.com/standard-size-servos/)

Secondary Scoring Mechanisms
________________

The secondary scoring mechanism encompasses anything that is not the primary scoring mechanism. Some examples include: 
    - Parking: Parking at different locations to score points. 
    - Hanging: Suspending by the trusses or another place to get more points :d 
    - Misc.: Mechanisms such as a paper airplane launcher scores more points, but are usually unrelated to the main scoring mechanism.
