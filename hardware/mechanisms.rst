Linear Slide

Our linear slides are bought from Gobilda (https://www.gobilda.com/linear-slides/).
They offer 240 and 336 mm long linear slides. Utilizing dark magic stringing, a motor can power the linear slide, allowing it to go up. This is useful because it allows mechanisms attached on the linear slide to reach very high places.
